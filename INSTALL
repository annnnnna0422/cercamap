Copy the 'SDKs/CercaMap' folder to ~/Library/SDKs. (You may haveI
to create that directory.)

To make use of this SDK, select your target in the left-hand menu and
click the blue Info button (Apple-i). Add the following new line to
the "Additional SDKs" option: "$HOME/Library/SDKs/CercaMap/$(PLATFORM_NAME).sdk". 
Finally you have to add the entry '-ObjC -lCercaMap' to the "Other Linker
Flags" option.
